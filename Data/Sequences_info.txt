This directory contains two DNA sequences in FASTA format:

1) Human_beta_globin:
   - The beta-globin gene from Homo sapiens (human).
   - Encodes part of the beta chain of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in red blood cells.
   - Sequence length: 90 nucleotides.

2) Chimp_beta_globin:
   - The beta-globin gene from Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee).
   - Very similar to the human beta-globin gene, reflecting close evolutionary relationship.
   - Sequence length: 90 nucleotides.

These sequences can be used for pairwise alignment and similarity comparison.
